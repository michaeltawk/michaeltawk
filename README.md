## Hi, I'm Michael 👋

I'm a **Backend & Data Engineer** working primarily with **Python and FastAPI**, building production-grade APIs, analytics services, and data pipelines.

In my day-to-day role, I design and maintain:
- 🚀 **FastAPI services** for time-series analytics and decision systems  
- 📊 **Data pipelines & aggregations** (PostgreSQL / TimescaleDB–style workloads)
- 🧠 **ML-assisted and rule-based engines** used for monitoring, KPIs, and business decisions
- 🐳 **Dockerized microservices** running in production environments

Alongside my work, I build **side projects** focused on automation and decision-making.

### 🔹 Current Side Project
**Walter 🤖📈** — an automated trading & decision engine  
Walter stores inputs, model decisions, and performance metrics to create **decision history** and enable continuous strategy improvement over time.

### 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Python, FastAPI
- **Data:** PostgreSQL, time-series data, analytics pipelines
- **Infra:** Docker, Linux
- **ML / Logic:** ML-driven signals, rule engines, LLM-assisted workflows
