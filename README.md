## Hi, I'm Michael 👋

I'm a **Backend & Data Engineer** working primarily with **Python and FastAPI**, building production-grade APIs, analytics services, and data pipelines.
I also have published research in an international scientific journal, focused on machine learning applications in engineering systems.

In my day-to-day role, I design and maintain:
- 🚀 **FastAPI services** for time-series analytics and decision systems  
- 📊 **Data pipelines & aggregations** (PostgreSQL / TimescaleDB–style workloads)
- 🧠 **ML-assisted and rule-based engines** used for monitoring, KPIs, and business decisions
- 🐳 **Dockerized microservices** running in production environments

Alongside my work, I build **side projects** focused on automation and decision-making.

### 🔹Current Side Project
**Walter 🤖📈** — an **LLM-driven trading & decision engine**

Walter uses **large language models (LLMs)** to reason over market data, signals, and contextual inputs in order to **make trading decisions**.  
Each decision is persisted alongside its inputs, rationale, and outcomes, creating a **decision history layer** that enables evaluation, iteration, and continuous improvement over time.

### 🔹Other Projects

- **DAURA** — an AI-based system for **DA (disadvantaged area) detection**  
A computer-vision project focused on detecting and localizing damaged areas in spatial/visual data, leveraging machine learning for automated analysis and classification.

- **Habit Tracker ✅** — a simple habit-tracking web application  
A lightweight application that helps users track daily habits and consistency over time, focusing on clean UX, persistence, and actionable progress insights.
